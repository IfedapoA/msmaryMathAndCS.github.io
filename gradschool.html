    <h3>About Graduate Schools</h3>
    <p>Many students from Mount St. Mary's University choose to further their education by pursuing graduate degrees at various 
        institutions. The Math and CS Department actively supports students in their graduate school journey through 
        personalized mentoring, application guidance, and connecting current students with alumni who have pursued 
        advanced degrees.</p>

    <h3>Graduate Schools & Programs</h3>
    <p>Here are some common graduate schools and programs our students pursue after graduation:</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Boston University - Boston, MA</h4>
        <p>Master's in Computer Science program offers a comprehensive curriculum focusing on theoretical 
            foundations and practical applications.</p>
        <h5>Core Program Requirements:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theory Course:</strong> GRS CS 630 – Theory of Computation</li>
            <li><strong>Software Course:</strong> GRS CS 611 – Software Engineering</li>
            <li><strong>Systems Course:</strong> Choose from:
                <ul>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Student Pathway:</h5>
        <p>Mount students who attend Boston University often build on a strong foundation in algorithms, 
            discrete math, and software development. The transition to BU’s graduate-level rigor is 
            supported by faculty mentorship and project-based learning. BU’s program also emphasizes 
            research — especially in areas like artificial intelligence, security, and data systems — 
            providing a great opportunity for students interested in academic or industry research roles.</p>
    
        <p>Many students take advantage of BU's location in the Boston tech corridor by pursuing 
            internships or co-op experiences with local startups, research labs, or companies like 
            HubSpot, IBM, and Amazon Robotics.</p>
