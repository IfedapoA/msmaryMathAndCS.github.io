## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

### Data Science Major Topic

Our page is about the Data Science Major here at Mount St. Mary's University. Our information was gathered from the university's catalog of majors, specifically the section on Data Science itself. This information was used to describe what the major itself is about and how it serves the student population and/or anyone that is interested in taking the major. We used most, if not all, of the information about the major that was offered by the university to put together our specific page and provide a detailed look into what the Data Science major has to offer here at the Mount.

The initial "Who oversees the Data Science program" section, includes information such as who teaches what classes and who heads the major, such as the dean and other administrators. This information was gathered from the Department of Math and CS page offered by the university.

"Who participates in Data Science Courses" includes the types of students that take the courses. These include data science majors, CS majors, and math majors, as outlined in this section of the page.

"What should one expect" from a Data Science course outlines what content the courses are about and includes different examples of the course workloads.

In order to outline data science post-college, the "What to expect after graduating as a Data Science major" section is next to show what can be done with the major. Applying a major after graduating from the university is one of the most important aspects.

"Notable Facts" concludes the Data Science page with a few other notes about the major.

All of these individual sections are followed with directions to sources.
