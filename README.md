## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

### Minors

This list of Mathematics and Computer Science Minors offered at Mount Saint Mary's University and what they entail was accessed from the University's official website. (https://msmary.edu/academics/majors-minors/)

**Computer Science**

From software developers creating the next app that improves our communities to network administrators who keep our organizations running smoothly, those working in computer science are shaping the world in important and meaningful ways.

The computer science program is part of the School of Science, Mathematics & Technology. Our goal as a department is to graduate women and men that are uniquely equipped to provide scientific perspective and solutions to the complex problems facing humanity.

**Cybersecurity**

The Mount’s cybersecurity minor offers a knowledge base in the design, operations and security of computer networks. Pair the minor with a criminal justice major and become a fraud analyst for law enforcement, an economics degree to pursue a career protecting financial data, or a political science major and work with federal agencies to keep our nation safe.

Technology is ever-changing. From developing new software to safeguard against hackers, to finding innovative ways to protect data, the skills of computer science and cybersecurity professionals are in high demand.

At the Mount, you'll have the option to double major in computer science and cybersecurity, giving you the skills needed to think critically while tackling advanced tech challenges. And since the computer science and cybersecurity majors overlap, it's possible to graduate with two degrees in four short years.

A double major in computer science and cybersecurity provides extra flexibility, allowing you to go directly into a job in software development, security or both. You will gain fundamental knowledge in programming, networking, operating systems and security, as well as become a strong problem solver. You’ll stand out amongst other students for your technical knowledge provided by your academic experiences.

**Data Science**

Data scientists extract meaning from complex data and transform it into useful data products. How can companies acquire data and prepare it for effective and predictive decision-making? Are there ethical considerations of data mining and privacy? How can big data solutions and statistical analysis shape the world around us and resolve problems facing humanity? Those who create machine learning models and communicate technical ideas with precision and clarity have a deep understanding of the ever-evolving world of data science.

The data science program is part of the School of Science, Mathematics & Technology. Our goal as a department is to graduate women and men that are uniquely equipped to provide scientific perspective and solutions to the complex problems facing humanity.

**Mathematics**

On any list of the best jobs in America, you'll find titles such as data scientist, mathematician, actuary and statistician toward the top, and there's a reason why. From figuring out how much insurance a family should purchase based on their stage in life to calculating how an organization makes sense of its sales data, mathematicians get to work on interesting problems that require creativity, flexibility and cleverness. These are precisely the abilities that a mathematics education from the Mount helps develop.

The undergraduate degree program in mathematics is part of the School of Science, Mathematics & Technology. Our goal as a department is to graduate women and men who are uniquely equipped to provide scientific perspective and solutions to the complex problems facing humanity.
