## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Mathematics major

**Process**
We gathered our information from two sources, the first being the Overview for the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (https://catalog.msmary.edu/content.php?catoid=14&navoid=593), and the second being the page giving information about the various classes a Mathematics major may expect to take throughout their years at the university (https://catalog.msmary.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=1203&returnto=593). We decided that all the information we included in our site was important for someone looking to learn about the major to know. For the styling of our page we decided that we would present our information in a question and answer format. We started by asking an important question to give context about the major, then answering it in an informative manner so the reader learns all they need to know.

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

## Usage

Students in the Software Development class are required to participate in this project as part of their classwork. Other GitHub users not in the class may also contribute, but may be rejected. See the [GitHub Docs: Contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for more guidance on contributing to a project on GitHub.
