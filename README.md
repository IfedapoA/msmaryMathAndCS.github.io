## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.


### Computer Science B.S. Major Web Page

The **Computer Science B.S.** webpage is designed to provide prospective students with valuable information regarding the major, its academic requirements, and career prospects. We gathered credible insights from sources such as [MichiganTech.com](https://www.michigantech.com), [BestSchools.com](https://www.bestschools.com), and [Mount St. Mary's University's Computer Science Page](https://www.msmu.edu). Additionally, **Dr. Lamprecht** shared an interesting fact about a former professor who built a personal computer that Mount faculty still maintain today, adding a historical and practical perspective to the major.

**Structure and Content**

We aimed to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly webpage by including the following sections:

- **Academic Requirements**: Clear guidelines on the courses and skills needed to complete the major.
- **Career Prospects**: A focus on potential job opportunities and career pathways after graduation.
- **Personal Insights**: We shared our experiences as current computer science students, offering advice on strategies for success and expectations in the program.

**Layout and Design**

We implemented the following structure in our webpage:

- **HTML Structure**: We used HTML to organize content effectively. Key sections are introduced using header tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) to define topics clearly. Paragraph tags (`<p>`) were used to display the researched content. Horizontal rule tags (`<hr>`) help separate sections for clarity and easy navigation.

- **CSS Styling**: The webpage was styled with a **blue and pink color scheme**, selected to convey the complexity and sophistication of the Computer Science field. We linked an external CSS stylesheet in the `<head>` section of the HTML file, pulling styles from the central repository for consistent design. This color palette was intended to highlight important topics while maintaining a professional aesthetic.

**Functionality and User Experience**

Our layout is intentionally minimalistic, focused on keeping the user experience simple and direct. The design avoids unnecessary complexity while emphasizing the most relevant information. Additionally, we included **hyperlinks** to reputable external sources, offering users the opportunity to access further details on the topics covered.

**Key Takeaways**

- We structured the content to be easily navigable and visually appealing.
- The design balances professional aesthetics with user-friendly navigation.
- External sources are cited properly, with hyperlinks included for further exploration.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

## Usage

Students in the Software Development class are required to participate in this project as part of their classwork. Other GitHub users not in the class may also contribute, but may be rejected. See the [GitHub Docs: Contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for more guidance on contributing to a project on GitHub.
